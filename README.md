# NLP_Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
## Overview       
Consumers will give their business to brands they trust, and emotions are at the heart of this trust. When people identify with a brand, it’s easy for them to support the company. Marketers work hard to build and strengthen emotional ties to help consumers feel they have a vested interest in the brand’s success.
There are 486 million users on twitter and a lot of brands have hopped onto the platform to reach these potential customers. With the ever increasing portfolio of products, there is also an increase in the sentiments held by people who have interacted with them. Sentiment analysis refers to identifying and classifying the opinions expressed in the text source. The results of the analysis will assist businesses in determining how consumers feel about their goods and services, providing information on where changes can be made and what can be promoted.
## Business Understanding
Twitter has become a major platform for many organisations worldwide to interact with their clients and other businesses. Major brands such as Google and Apple have a large following on twitter hence this platform offers a direct point of contact to their large pool of users. The composition users range from those who like, hate or are neutral towards a particular product, marketing strategy or proposed changes.
This pool of diverse users helps a brand, such as Google and Apple, identify a consumer’s sentiment towards its products and services thus leading to insights on where to bring improvements and what to promote.
## Data Understanding
In this section, we will able to get an understanding of the dataset we are working with. 
We found out that the dataset has 9093 entries and 3 columns and the column names are as follows: tweet_text, emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at and is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product.
We also checked for duplicates and missing values too.
## Data Preparation
This was quite an interesting bit, where we got to prepare the data for modeling. These are the steps we carried out: 
-	Renaming the columns
-	Removing missing values from tweet text
-	Handle the duplicated data by dropping them.
-	Remove capitalization, punctuation and stop words
-	Fill the missing values of sentiments with their appropriate values
